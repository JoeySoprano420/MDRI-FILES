  ```plaintext
  BLOCK OuterBlock {
      DEFINE INT counter = 0;
      BLOCK InnerBlock {
          DEFINE STRING counter = "Nested";
          PRINT "Inner counter is " + counter; // Prints "Nested"
      }
      PRINT "Outer counter is " + counter; // Prints 0
  }
  ```

- **Meta-Programming:**
  ```plaintext
  DEFINE FUNCTION generateCode {
      PRINT "This code was generated dynamically";
  }
  
  EXECUTE generateCode; // Executes dynamically generated code
  ```

- **Declarative and Imperative Integration:**
  ```plaintext
  DEFINE INT total = 0;
  FOR EACH ITEM IN LIST {
      total += ITEM;
  }
  ```

#### 2. **AI-Based Error Handling**

- **Predictive AI and Self-Healing:**
  ```plaintext
  PREDICT SYSTEM_LOAD {
      IF PREDICTED_LOAD > 80% {
          AUTOMATICALLY SCALE RESOURCES;
          SWITCH TO BACKUP_SYSTEM;
      }
  }

  MONITOR SYSTEM {
      IF ERROR_TYPE = "Memory Leak" {
          APPLY FIXES AUTOMATICALLY BASED ON HISTORICAL DATA;
          NOTIFY ADMIN IF RESOLUTION FAILS;
      }
  }
  ```

- **Advanced Error Learning:**
  ```plaintext
  CATCH ERROR {
      DLVD_LEARNING {
          LEARN FROM CONTEXT OF ERROR;
          UPDATE ERROR_HANDLING_STRATEGY;
      }
  }
  ```

#### 3. **Event-Driven Programming**

- **Complex Event Processing (CEP):**
  ```plaintext
  DEFINE EVENT_PATTERN "HighTraffic" {
      MATCH EVENTS WHERE TRAFFIC > 1000;
      TRIGGER ALERT "High traffic detected";
  }
  ```

- **Real-Time Analytics and Feedback:**
  ```plaintext
  ANALYZE EVENTS IN REAL_TIME {
      ADJUST EVENT_PRIORITY BASED ON ANALYTICS;
      PROVIDE FEEDBACK TO EVENT_MANAGER;
  }
  ```

- **Distributed Event Handling:**
  ```plaintext
  DISTRIBUTE EVENTS {
      USE MULTIPLE NODES;
      ENSURE EVENT_PROCESSING_ACROSS_NODES;
  }
  ```

#### 4. **Network and Retry Logic**

- **Adaptive Network Protocols:**
  ```plaintext
  USE ADAPTIVE_PROTOCOL {
      SWITCH TO UDP IF LATENCY > 100ms;
      COMPRESS DATA IF BANDWIDTH < 1MBps;
  }
  ```

- **Intelligent Failover Mechanisms:**
  ```plaintext
  IF NETWORK_FAIL {
      PERFORM HEALTH_CHECK ON BACKUP_SYSTEM;
      IF BACKUP_HEALTHY {
          SWITCH TO BACKUP_SYSTEM;
      } ELSE {
          NOTIFY ADMIN;
      }
  }
  ```

- **Dynamic Timeouts and Backoff Strategies:**
  ```plaintext
  NETWORK_RETRY {
      BACKOFF STRATEGY BASED ON ERROR_TYPE;
      INCREASE_TIMEOUT IF RETRY_ATTEMPTS > 3;
  }
  ```

#### 5. **Resource Management**

- **AI-Powered Resource Allocation:**
  ```plaintext
  ALLOCATE RESOURCES BASED ON AI_MODEL("UsagePredictor") {
      SCALE CPU AND MEMORY;
      BALANCE NETWORK BANDWIDTH;
  }
  ```

- **Predictive Scaling and Optimization:**
  ```plaintext
  PREDICT RESOURCE_NEEDS {
      SCALE RESOURCES BASED ON FORECAST;
      OPTIMIZE RESOURCE_ALLOCATION FOR PEAK TIMES;
  }
  ```

- **Automated Optimization:**
  ```plaintext
  OPTIMIZE RESOURCES {
      ADJUST BASED ON REAL_TIME_PERFORMANCE_DATA;
      APPLY AI_RECOMMENDATIONS;
  }
  ```

#### 6. **Data Processing**

- **Advanced Data Security and Privacy:**
  ```plaintext
  HANDLE DATA {
      ENCRYPT DATA_AT_REST;
      ANONYMIZE DATA_IN_TRANSIT;
      ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH GDPR AND CCPA;
  }
  ```

- **AI-Powered Data Insights:**
  ```plaintext
  ANALYZE DATA WITH AI_MODEL("InsightGenerator") {
      EXTRACT TRENDS;
      PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS BASED ON ANALYSIS;
  }
  ```

- **Automated Data Validation and Sanitization:**
  ```plaintext
  VALIDATE DATA {
      AUTOMATICALLY SANITIZE AND VALIDATE;
      REPORT ERRORS TO DATA_ADMIN;
  }
  ```

#### 7. **Unified Logging, Monitoring, and Analytics**

- **Unified Observability:**
  ```plaintext
  INTEGRATE LOGGING_AND_MONITORING {
      COLLECT DATA FROM ALL SOURCES;
      ANALYZE IN REAL_TIME;
      PROVIDE DASHBOARD VISUALIZATIONS;
  }
  ```

- **Proactive Issue Management:**
  ```plaintext
  MONITOR SYSTEM {
      USE PREDICTIVE_ANALYTICS TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL ISSUES;
      AUTOMATICALLY RESOLVE OR ESCALATE BASED ON SEVERITY;
  }
  ```

- **Comprehensive Reporting and Alerts:**
  ```plaintext
  GENERATE REPORTS {
      INCLUDE PERFORMANCE_METRICS;
      PROVIDE ALERTS FOR CRITICAL_EVENTS;
      DISTRIBUTE TO RELEVANT_STAKEHOLDERS;
  }
  ```
